# Smart Queueing System

This is the second project in IntelÂ® Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree program. The project involves choosing the right the Hardware for different circumstances. This repository contains a number of Jupyter notebooks to be executed in the Intel DevCloud from a Udacity workspace.

## Main Tasks
1. Proposing a possible hardware solution for the given circumstance.
2. Building out the application and testing its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Comparing the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revising the proposal based on the test results

## Scenarios
- A Manufacturing setting
- A Retail setting
- A Transportation setting

## Steps involved
1. Created the Python script
2. Created the Job Submission script
3. Executed all the scenarios for all hardware types (CPU, GPU, VPU & FPGA) and compare the performance.
